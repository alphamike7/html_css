<h1 id="primary">Seventh semester EC boy's global elective attempt</h1>
<p>A young engineering student has failed to be included in the final list of all the  13 global electives.
</p>
<p>Shane David is a seventh semester EC student studying at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology. The first list of the global electives provided by the college was published around 10:00 IST on 5th January, 2019.</p>
<div class="element"><p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">"“Was it my fault that I wasn't included in the list? My name was given for the elective. Who controls this list? You'll never walk again!” - @shanedavid10</span></p>
</div>

<p>Only 60 students will be included for a single elective and more than 1200 responses came from the 750 students. Shane was a 'few' minutes late for giving his name for the course. </p>
<p>Shane was out with his cousins while the selection process for the electives were going on. He gave the job of giving his name for the course to his trusted friend Achyuth P. But even this was not enough. When asked about the situation, his friend Abin Thomas #wolfiez consoled him by saying something like 'Don't worry, only a 1000 people have signed up for the electives. You can take your time and give the name' #teamwolfiez. Empowered by these words, Shane decided to not give his name for any other elective other than what was already given. </p>
<p>Even though many students were giving their names for more than one course for confirming their place for the elective, Shane was confident he would be getting the elective. After hearing the news that he didn't got in, he decided to sue the college and it's staff for unfair selection for the electives.</p>
<p>What do you think of this? Is Shane right to sue the college? Or should he just come to his senses? Give your feedback on the issue. </p>
